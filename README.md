Group 3: Project Proposal

We collected socioeconomic parameters such as unemployment rates, salary rates etc. and compare them with crime rates. 

We created a multilayer geo-map that will toggle between unemployment, poverty rates and crime statistics for the city of Chicago. 

We created interactive plotly bar and bubble charts.

We utilized Python API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, postgress-SQL.
